# PocketBar

## What is PocketBar?
Pocket Bar is an app built in Xamarin Forms that extracts cocktail information from TheCocktailDB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)  and presents it to the user in a fun, interactive way.
Among other things, it allows a user to:
* List cocktails By Name, Category, Glass Type, Ingredient or Random.
* Given a certain Cocktail, visualize: Picture, Description, Recipe (Ingredients & Instructions) and Glass Type.
* Given a certain Ingredient, visualize: Image, Name & Description.
* Favorite and Share Cocktails for easy access.
